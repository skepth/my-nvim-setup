## Key VIM Shortcuts

Note: Every shortcut described in this section is case sensitive.

### Mode Changes

#### INSERT Mode
* Using `a` will cause vim to go into insert mode but with the cursor to the
right side of the character the curser was pointing to.

* Using `O` will cause vim to go into insert mode but with the cursor on a
newline above from where the curser was currently at.
